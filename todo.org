See:
1. [[https://github.com/unravel-team/mcp-clojure-server-deps-new][mcp-clojure-server-deps-new]] for a ~deps-new~ based template
2. [[https://github.com/unravel-team/example-cool-mcp-server][example-cool-mcp-server]] for a Github template project
* TODO Add an integration test for end-to-end testing the server
See ~integration.client~ from ~lsp4clj~ for inspiration
* TODO Checks and Balances in the mcp-cljc-sdk code
** TODO Make sure that handle-* functions are implement proper checks
Read through the python decorator code to double-check if we are doing the right thing here.
** TODO Implement best practices for prompts
** TODO Implement best practices for tools
** TODO Implement best practices for resources
** TODO Ensure that error handling is correctly done for transports
** TODO Implement best practices for transports
* TODO Implement the entire roots section of the protocol
* TODO Implement the entire sampling section of the protocol
* TODO Implement a Stdio-transport based Client
* TODO Implement the SSE Transport
** TODO Implement the SSE-transport based server
** TODO Implement the SSE-transport based client
* TODO Create a CLI tool for how tools, prompts, resources should be defined
1. Easily create new projects, in ~deps-new~ style
2. Organize them properly, making it possible to build servers fast.
3. Make it language-agnostic, allowing the tool to create Clojure, Python, TS projects.
* TODO Explore babashka as the runner in Claude Desktop / Inspector
The current code is wildly incompatible with bb, so this is a long-shot. But bb compatibility will mean speed and ease of use.
