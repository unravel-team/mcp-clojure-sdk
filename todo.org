Read through the python decorator code to double-check if we are doing the right thing here.
** TODO Implement best practices for prompts

- Currently, the SDK determines the capabilities of the project at start time, based on the tools, prompts, resources defined by the developer.
- To make it more LSP like, we need dynamic capability negotiation.
- Note that this is a low-priority item because I cannot even find LSP projects which use too much of dynamic capability negotiation

* TODO Implement the entire sampling section of the protocol
* TODO Create a CLI tool for how tools, prompts, resources should be defined
1. Easily create new projects, in ~deps-new~ style
2. Organize them properly, making it possible to build servers fast.
3. Make it language-agnostic, allowing the tool to create Clojure, Python, TS projects.
* TODO Explore babashka as the runner in Claude Desktop / Inspector
The current code is wildly incompatible with bb, so this is a long-shot. But bb compatibility will mean speed and ease of use.
