* TODO Create a CLI tool for how tools, prompts, resources should be defined
1. Easily create new projects, in ~deps-new~ style
2. Organize them properly, making it possible to build servers fast.
3. Make it language-agnostic, allowing the tool to create Clojure, Python, TS projects.
* TODO Explore babashka as the runner in Claude Desktop / Inspector
The current code is wildly incompatible with bb, so this is a long-shot. But bb compatibility will mean speed and ease of use.
